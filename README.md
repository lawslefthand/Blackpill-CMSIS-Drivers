# 🛠️ STM32 Blackpill CMSIS Drivers

A collection of CMSIS and HAL drivers written in C for the STM32F401CEU-based **Blackpill** development boards. This repository provides clean, modular, and reusable drivers for common peripherals, offering full control over the hardware. F411CEU boards can also use this drivers albeit with minor clock config modifications in the source files. New drivers are regularly added!

## 📆 Features

- 🧱 Modular and scalable driver architecture
- 🚀 Optimized for performance and low overhead
- 💻 Easily portable to other STM32F4 series MCUs
- 🧪 Tested on STM3F401CEU Blackpill boards

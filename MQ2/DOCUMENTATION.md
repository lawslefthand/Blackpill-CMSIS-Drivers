## üîç 3. MQ2 Sensor Working Principle

The MQ2 sensor detects gas concentrations based on a change in resistance of a heated sensitive material(TIN DIOXIDE). The sensor outputs an analog voltage proportional to gas concentration.

- **Rs**: Sensor resistance in gas
- **Ro**: Sensor resistance in clean air

The relationship follows this equation:
![Relation](images/FORMULA1.jpg)


Where `A` and `B` are constants from the MQ2 datasheet (varies by gas type).

## üß™ 4. Calibration Method

1. **Environment**: Sensor powered on for 24 hours in clean air (burn-in time).
2. **Measured Ro**: Using voltage divider formula:                          Rs = (Vc * RL / Vout) - RL
3. **Known Clean Air Value**:
- `Rs/Ro ‚âà 9.8` in clean air (from MQ2 datasheet)
- Calculated `Ro` using average `Rs / 9.8`



## Constant's A and B 
The constants value is not given in many datasheets so you may have to find on your own .
First of we have to understand that the MQ2 sensor responda to change in multiple gases ,following is its sensitivity curve provided in the datasheet

![Curve](images/CURVE.png)

So the graph here is a Logarithmic graph , you must understand how to read a logarithmic graph . YT link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ8S9q1R_bg

So we can see that the X-Axis is PPM and the Y-Axis is ratio Rs/Ro.

It is also of form y=mx+b where m is slope . We can also write it as y=ax+b ,so a is slope and b is the y intercept also  y is log(PPM) & x is log(Rs/Ro).

Now if we solve for a and b we get  :  a=x2-x1/y2-y1  and b=x1-ay1

![Formula ](images/FORMULA2.jpg)

Here to get x1,x2,y1 and y2 : Select any 2 points which are clearly visible on the graph for any gas you select mark them as P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2).

Once you get them use them in your code .

### I found the constant as :
                        - 1. LPG gas a=(-2.347),b=2.780.
                        - 2. H2 gas  a=(-1.45),b=3.
                        - 3. CH4 gas  a=(-3.021),b=3.742.
                        - 4. CO gas   a=(-3.811),b=4.818.
Update the value of constant in code according to the gas you want to measure.

## Output Example

The UART output (115200 baud rate) looks like:
**The sensor value is : 30 PPM**

---

## How to Build

1. Open the project in **STM32CubeIDE** or **Keil uVision**.
2. Ensure correct ADC and UART pins are configured in `.ioc` or `main.c`.
3. Compile and flash the code to your STM32 board.
4. Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, TeraTerm) to view output.



## MQ2 Sensor Working Principle

The MQ2 sensor detects gas concentrations based on a change in resistance of a heated sensitive material(TIN DIOXIDE). The sensor outputs an analog voltage proportional to gas concentration.

- **Rs**: Sensor resistance in gas
- **Ro**: Sensor resistance in clean air

  
## Calibration Method

1. **Environment**: Sensor powered on for 24 hours in clean air (burn-in time).
2. **Measured Ro**: Using voltage divider formula:           Rs = (Vc * RL / Vout) - RL
3. **Known Clean Air Value**:
- `Rs/Ro â‰ˆ 9.8` in clean air (from MQ2 datasheet)
- Calculated `Ro` using average `Rs / 9.8`
